# 📱 Screen Time & Productivity Analysis

This project investigates the relationship between daily screen time and self-reported productivity using personal screen usage data.

## 📊 Hypotheses
> **Null Hypothesis (H0): "Screen time and productivity are not related."**

> **Alternative Hypothesis (H1): "Increased screen time reduces productivity."**

While screen time for social media and entertainment may hinder productivity, academic and professional use (e.g., studying, working) is essential and productive. This project aims to explore both aspects.

## 🗂️ Files

- `main.py` — Python script for data analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualizations.
- `custom_screen_time_data.csv` — Personal screen time data collected from March 11 to April 25.
- `processed_screen_time_data.csv` — File generated after running the analysis script.

## 🧪 How It Works

The script performs:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualizations (histograms, pairplots, time series)
- Correlation and hypothesis testing

## 🧰 Dependencies
Install required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy
