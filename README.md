Project Proposal: The Impact of Screen Time on Productivity

1. Introduction
In the digital era, screen time has become a part of everyday life with both positive and negative effects. While excessive screen time is related to distractions and decreased productivity, digital tools are also required for academic and professional work. The purpose of this study is to investigate the interaction between screen time and productivity by testing the hypothesis: "Increased screen time reduces productivity."

The study will consider both supporting and opposing arguments, considering that social media and watching activities can hinder productivity, but  screen use for work and studies is necessary for efficiency and success.

2. Objectives
Main Objective: Determine if increased screen usage negatively affects productivity.

Secondary Objectives:
Differentiating between productive and non-productive screen usage.

Determining trends regarding the effects of screen use on task performance as well as overall efficiency.

3. Data Collection Methodology
Tools Used:
Screen Time Tracker: Utilizing native phone settings (iOS Screen Time, Android Digital Wellbeing) to track daily use.

Daily Productivity Log: Tracking tasks done, study time, or self-reported productivity level.

Categorization: Breaking down screen time into academic/productive vs. entertainment/non-productive.

4. Analysis Plan
Comparing total screen time with self-reported productivity.

Finding correlations between different types of screen time and levels of productivity.

Looking for trends, e.g., whether lower productivity is linked to excessive social media usage.

Exploring what amount of screen time starts to impact efficiency measurably.

5. Expected Challenges
Self-reporting bias in work logs.

Limited ability to separate productive from unproductive screen use.

Variability in work/study habits and multitasking ability.

6. Expected Outcome
Gaining some insight into how different types of screen time affect productivity.

A balanced discussion on how screen time can both enhance and hinder productivity.

Practical tips on how to manage screen time for optimal productivity.

By investigating these factors, this study aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of screen time's impact, helping individuals make informed decisions about their digital habits.
